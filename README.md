Amir's first swift project: a tip calculator



--- Pre-Work Instructions - Due 10/11 --

The next step is to submit an initial project which is a simple Tip Calculator application that will introduce each of you to several key iOS development topics before the class even begins:

1. Start reading about Swift, check out the Treehouse tutorials:
http://teamtreehouse.com/library/swift-basics">Swift Basics
http://teamtreehouse.com/library/swift-functions-a...">Swift Functions and Optionals
2. Finally, you need to develop a Tip Calculator application.
Download Xcode 7 from the App Store.
Follow this https://vimeo.com/102084767 video walkthrough. Note that there is one thing that changed in the beta release that doesn't work anymore. In the line where I use bridgeToObjectiveC, use the following line:
var billAmount = NSString(string: billField.text!).doubleValue
Consider adding optional features, more details https://gist.github.com/timothy1ee/434cc97da182c49... here. The point of the optional features isn't to test what you can figure out on your own. If you have an idea of something you want to try, email tim@codepath.com, and he'll point you in the right direction.
Submit your work on GitHub by copying the README template here. Be sure to include an animated gif, it only takes a moment to create with LICEcap. To finish your submission, create a GitHub issue and include @codepathreview in the issue body (not the title). Email tim@codepath.com if you're having trouble with GitHub.
